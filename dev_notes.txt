-- Things to Keep in Mind / Tips --

To use the console, type “rake console”

When calling int_input, make sure to start your string with a newline character by typing “int_input(“\nmessage”, [lower_limit, upper_limit]). This keeps things from getting too cluttered.

To reset data after testing stuff out, type “rake db:seed”. This will set the data to whatever is in the seeds file.





-- To Fix/Bugs --

Get rid of weekends in appointment slots!

When no appointments to cancel, it should say that, and return to home.

Add ability to exit from the login screen earlier 


-- To-Do / To Implement --


Methods or method changes to implement:

List tutor time slots in create appointment menu

Implement any additional base methods in classes (preferably keep methods in the Student class as this is the user - unless it makes sense to put a method in another class)

Implement all methods in menus

Make the app prettier (top priority: clear screens, new lines where necessary, lower priority: logos, colors, tables, etc)

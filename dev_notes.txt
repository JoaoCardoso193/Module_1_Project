-- Things to Keep in Mind / Tips --

To use the console, type “rake console”

When calling int_input, make sure to start your string with a newline character by typing “int_input(“\nmessage”, [lower_limit, upper_limit]). This keeps things from getting too cluttered.

To reset data after testing stuff out, type “rake db:seed”. This will set the data to whatever is in the seeds file.





-- To Fix/Bugs --

Get rid of weekends in appointment slots!

When no appointments to cancel, it should say that, and return to home.

Add ability to exit from the login screen earlier 




-- To-Do / To Implement --


Methods or method changes to implement:

1. Ability to change note in create appointment screen (THIS IS CRUCIAL AS ABILITY TO UPDATE DATABASE IS ONE OF THE PROJECT CRITERIA)

2. List tutor time slots in create appointment menu

3. Implement Password at login

4. Implement any additional base methods in classes (preferably keep methods in the Student class as this is the user - unless it makes sense to put a method in another class)

5. Implement all methods in menus

6. Make the app prettier (top priority: clear screens, new lines where necessary, lower priority: logos, colors, tables, etc)

-- Things to Keep in Mind / Tips --

To use the console, type “rake console”

When calling int_input, make sure to start your string with a newline character by typing “int_input(“\nmessage”, [lower_limit, upper_limit]). This keeps things from getting too cluttered.

To reset data after testing stuff out, type “rake db:seed”. This will set the data to whatever is in the seeds file.

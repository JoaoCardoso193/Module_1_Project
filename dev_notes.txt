-- Things to Keep in Mind / Tips --

To use the console, type “rake console”

When calling int_input, make sure to start your string with a newline character by typing “int_input(“\nmessage”, [lower_limit, upper_limit]). This keeps things from getting too cluttered.

To reset data after testing stuff out, type “rake db:seed”. This will set the data to whatever is in the seeds file.

-- To Fix/Bugs --

None :)

Add: If one tries to book an appointment on the weekend or outside the available times, it should specify "the tutors workhours are ..." or
"even tutors need to take a break on weekends."

Add: Maybe we should lose the possibility to book in Jan-Jun12th, leaving only future dates until the end of the year? 
Should also probably specify that it's 2020 we're referring to.

Add: "Start time" for appointment should be listed a little neater.

Bug: If I book an appointment, then cancel it, it seems that the option is then duplicated in available choices
Bug: Once appointment is booked, it's not removed from available options for
the same day neither for the original user, nor for any other users. Should have This
instead of "/n Appointment taken, please select another time slot" for an improved
user journey.

-- To-Do / To Implement --

1. Simplify seed file repetition in loops by creating a method

2. Implement any new methods that might be wanted & make the app pretier (logos, colors, maybe even tables)

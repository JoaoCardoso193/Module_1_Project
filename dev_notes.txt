-- Things to Keep in Mind / Tips --

To use the console, type “rake console”

When calling int_input, make sure to start your string with a newline character by typing “int_input(“\nmessage”, [lower_limit, upper_limit]). This keeps things from getting too cluttered.

To reset data after testing stuff out, type “rake db:seed”. This will set the data to whatever is in the seeds file.





-- To Fix/Bugs --

Right now, if an appointment is canceled in the upcoming appointments menu, sometimes the wrong appointment gets canceled, and every time all other appointments have their id incremented by 1.




-- To-Do / To Implement --


Methods or method changes to implement:

in student.create_appointment method, it should check it time slot is already taken (make they start and end on the hour - should be easily achieved by using int_input)

in student.create_appointment method, it should check if entered date time is valid (for example, no appointment on February 20th) - if it’s invalid, instead of breaking the application with an error, it should just puts “invalid date” and restart the process of making an appointment

When canceling an appointment, if a student enters an id of an appointment that does not belong to them, or an id of an appointment that  doesn’t exist, it shouldn’t break the application



Implement any additional base methods in classes (preferably keep methods in the Student class as this is the user - unless it makes sense to put a method in another class)

Implement all methods in menus

Make the app prettier (top priority: clear screens, new lines where necessary, lower priority: logos, colors, tables, etc)
